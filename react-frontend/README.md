### To manage authentication state in my React app, I will:

#### 1. Create a context for authentication.
#### 2. Store the JWT token securely.
#### 3. Provide helper functions for login, logout, and user session management.

### Steps:

#### 1. Create a new folder in React app: src/context.
#### 2. Inside the context folder, create a file called AuthContext.tsx.
#### 3. Wrap application with the AuthProvider to provide authentication state globally.

### To manage authentication state in my React app, I will:

#### 1. Create a context for authentication.
#### 2. Store the JWT token securely.
#### 3. Provide helper functions for login, logout, and user session management.
#### 4. Checking the user's authentication state (based on the presence of a valid token).
#### 5. Redirecting unauthenticated users to the login page.

### Steps:

#### 1. Create a new folder in React app: src/context.
#### 2. Inside the context folder, create a file called AuthContext.tsx.
#### 3. Wrap application with the AuthProvider to provide authentication state globally.
#### 4. Create login and register webpages.
#### 5. Create a Protected Route Component This component will act as a wrapper for routes that require authentication.
#### 6. Use the Protected Route component to wrap routes that require authentication.
#### 7. Creating working flow between /register, /login and /dhasboard pages.

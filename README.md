#### Step 7: Viewing Project Details

#### In this step, you will enable users to click on a project in the dashboard and view its detailed information on a separate page. This involves:

##### 1. Adding a route and page for project details in the frontend.
##### 2. Creating a backend API to fetch a single project by ID.
##### 3. Integrating the frontend with the backend to display project details dynamically.
